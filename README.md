Access Log Analysis for mirrors.ustc.edu.cn

Includes scripts in bash, C and PHP, LaTeX source and PDF slides. Note that this is NOT a general software, it is specificly written for Mirrors.ustc and there are many hard-coded and copy-paste stuff.

However you may find something useful or inspiring if you are going to do some simple statistics on HTTP access logs. If you are working with a really large access log, please rewrite PHP in C for performance (I will do this if time allowed).

If you are first time to this repo, please read latex/mirrors.pdf to get a rough understanding of what this repo is all about.
